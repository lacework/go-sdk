Run and manage Lacework Query Language (LQL) queries.

To provide customizable specification of datasets, Lacework provides the Lacework
Query Language (LQL). LQL is a human-readable text syntax for specifying selection,
filtering, and manipulation of data.

Currently, Lacework has introduced LQL for configuration of AWS CloudTrail policies
and queries. This means you can use LQL to customize AWS CloudTrail policies only.
For all other policies, use the previous existing methods.

Lacework ships a set of default LQL queries that are available in your account.

For more information about LQL, visit:

  https://docs.lacework.com/lql-overview

To view all LQL queries in your Lacework account.

    lacework query ls

To show a query.

    lacework query show <query_id>

To execute a query.

    lacework query run <query_id>

**NOTE: LQL syntax may change.**
