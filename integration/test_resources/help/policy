policyManage policies in your Lacework account.

A policy is a mechanism used to add annotated metadata to a Lacework query for improving
the context of alerts, reports, and information displayed in the Lacework Console.

A policy also facilitates the scheduled execution of a Lacework query

A query is a mechanism used to interactively request information from a specific
curated dataset. A query has a defined structure for authoring detections.

Lacework ships a set of default LQL policies that are available in your account.

Limitations:
  * The maximum number of records that each policy will return is 1000
  * The maximum number of API calls is 120 per hour for ad-hoc LQL query executions

To view all the policies in your Lacework account.
