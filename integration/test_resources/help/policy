Manage policies in your Lacework account.

Policies add annotated metadata to queries for improving the context of alerts,
reports, and information displayed in the Lacework Console.

Policies also facilitate the scheduled execution of Lacework queries.

Queries let you interactively request information from specified
curated datasources. Queries have a defined structure for authoring detections.

Lacework ships a set of default LQL policies that are available in your account.

Limitations:
  * The maximum number of records that each policy will return is 1000
  * The maximum number of API calls is 120 per hour for on-demand LQL query executions

To view all the policies in your Lacework account.

    lacework policy ls

To view more details about a single policy.

    lacework policy show <policy_id>

To view the LQL query associated with the policy, use the query ID.

**Note: LQL syntax may change.**
