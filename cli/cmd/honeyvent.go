	// List of Features
	//
	// A feature within the Lacework CLI is any functionality that
	// can't be traced or tracked by the default event sent to Honeycomb,
	// it is a behavior that we, Lacework engineers, would like to
	// trace and understand its usage and adoption.
	//
	// By default the Feature field within the Honeyvent is empty,
	// define a new feature below and set it before sending a new
	// Honeyvent. Additionally, there is a FeatureData field that
	// any feature can use to inject any specific information
	// related to that feature.
	//
	// Example:
	//
	// ```go
	// cli.Event.Feature = featPollCtrScan
	// cli.Event.AddFeatureField("key", "value")
	// cli.SendHoneyvent()
	// ```
