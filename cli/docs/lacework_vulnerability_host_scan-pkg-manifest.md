## lacework vulnerability host scan-pkg-manifest

request an on-demand host vulnerability assessment from a package-manifest

### Synopsis

Request an on-demand host vulnerability assessment of your software packages to
determine if the packages contain any common vulnerabilities and exposures.

Simple usage:

    $ lacework vulnerability host scan-pkg-manifest '{
        "os_pkg_info_list": [
            {
                "os":"Ubuntu",
                "os_ver":"18.04",
                "pkg": "openssl",
                "pkg_ver": "1.1.1-1ubuntu2.1~18.04.5"
            }
        ]
    }'

To generate a package-manifest from the local host and scan it automatically:

    $ lacework vulnerability host scan-pkg-manifest --local

(*) NOTE:
 - Only packages managed by a package manager for supported OS's are reported.
 - Calls to this operation are rate limited to 10 calls per hour, per access key.
 - This operation is limited to 1k of packages per payload. If you require a payload
   larger than 1k, you must make multiple requests.
