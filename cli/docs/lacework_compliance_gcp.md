compliance for Google Cloud

### Synopsis

Manage compliance reports for Google Cloud.

To get the latest GCP compliance assessment report, use the command:

    $ lacework compliance gcp get-report <organization_id> <project_id>

These reports run on a regular schedule, typically once a day.

To find out which GCP organizations/projects are connected to your
Lacework account, use the following command:

    $ lacework integrations list --type GCP_CFG

Then, choose one integration, copy the GUID and visualize its details
using the command:

    $ lacework integration show <int_guid>

To list all GCP projects from an organization, use the command:

    $ lacework compliance gcp list-projects <organization_id>

To run an ad-hoc compliance assessment use the command:

    $ lacework compliance gcp run-assessment <org_or_project_id>
