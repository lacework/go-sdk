## lacework account

Manage accounts in an organization (org admins only)

### Synopsis

Manage accounts inside your Lacework organization.

An organization can contain multiple accounts so you can also manage components
such as alerts, resource groups, team members, and audit logs at a more granular
level inside an organization. A team member may have access to multiple accounts
and can easily switch between them.

To enroll your Lacework account in an organization follow the documentation:

  https://docs.lacework.com/organization-overview
