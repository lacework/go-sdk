## Before getting started

Read the [README.md](https://github.com/lacework/go-sdk/blob/main/README.md), the [development documentation](https://github.com/lacework/go-sdk/tree/main/cli#development) 
and the Lacework CLI documentation on the [wiki](https://github.com/lacework/go-sdk/wiki/CLI-Documentation).


## How to contribute?
There are 3 ways that community members can help contribute to the Lacework CLI.
Reporting any issues you may find either in functionality of the CLI or documentation. Or if you believe some functionality should exist
within the Lacework CLI you can make a feature request. Finally, if you've gone one step further and made the changes to submit for a pull request.

### Reporting Bugs

Ensure the issue you are raising has not already been created under [issues](https://github.com/lacework/go-sdk/issues).

If no current issue addresses the problem, open a new [issue](https://github.com/lacework/go-sdk/issues/new).
Include as much relevant information as possible. See the [bug template](https://github.com/lacework/go-sdk/blob/main/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md) for help on creating a new issue.

### Feature Requests

If you wish to submit a request to add new functionality or an improvement to the go-sdk then use the the [feature request](https://github.com/lacework/go-sdk/blob/main/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.md) template to 
open a new [issue](https://github.com/lacework/go-sdk/issues/new)

### Creating a Pull Request

When submitting a pull request follow the [commit message standard](#commit-message-standard).
Reduce the likelihood of pushing breaking changes by running the go-sdk unit and integration tests, 
see [development documentation](https://github.com/lacework/go-sdk/tree/main/cli#development).

Thanks,
